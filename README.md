Check out [WEATCHER APP LIVE DEMO](https://weather-app-oxa.herokuapp.com/) here!!

This is a simple weather app I made using React just to test using https://openweathermap.org/ APIs. 

Still a work in progress. 

To use openweathermap, sign up and receive an api key. 


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`
